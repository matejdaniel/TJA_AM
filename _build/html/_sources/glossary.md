# Glossary of Key Terms

**Arthroplasty:** The surgical reconstruction or replacement of a joint. Total arthroplasty involves replacing the entire joint, whereas hemiarthroplasty replaces only one articular surface.

**Articular Cartilage:** The highly specialized, smooth connective tissue that covers the ends of bones within synovial joints, providing a low-friction surface for movement.

**Avascular Necrosis (AVN):** The death of bone tissue resulting from a disruption of its blood supply. Also referred to as osteonecrosis.

**Hemiarthroplasty:** A surgical procedure that replaces one half of a joint, most commonly the femoral head in the context of a hip fracture.

**Non-union:** A serious complication of a fracture in which the bone fails to heal or fuse together properly.

**Osteophyte:** An osseous excrescence or bony spur that typically forms along the margins of a joint affected by osteoarthritis.

**Pannus:** An abnormal, inflammatory, and proliferative synovial tissue that is characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis. It adheres to and erodes articular cartilage and subchondral bone.

**Subchondral Bone:** The layer of bone situated immediately beneath the articular cartilage. It undergoes significant remodeling, including sclerosis and cyst formation, in osteoarthritis.

**Synovium (Synovial Membrane):** A specialized membrane that lines the inner surface of synovial joints and produces synovial fluid, which serves to lubricate the joint and nourish the articular cartilage.

# Basic Anatomical Terminology

A standard frame of reference for anatomical description and dissection. It is defined as:
* Standing upright
* Head level and eyes facing directly forward
* Feet flat on the floor and directed forward
* Upper limbs at the sides with the palms turned forward

## Directional Terms

Directional terms describe the position of one body part relative to another.

**Superior (Cranial):** Toward the head end or upper part of a structure or the body; above.
*Example: The head is superior to the abdomen.*

**Inferior (Caudal):** Away from the head end or toward the lower part of a structure or the body; below.
*Example: The navel is inferior to the chin.*

**Anterior (Ventral):** Toward or at the front of the body; in front of.
*Example: The breastbone is anterior to the spine.*

**Posterior (Dorsal):** Toward or at the back of the body; behind.
*Example: The heart is posterior to the breastbone.*

**Medial:** Toward or at the midline of the body; on the inner side of.
*Example: The heart is medial to the arm.*

**Lateral:** Away from the midline of thebody; on the outer side of.
*Example: The arms are lateral to the chest.*

**Proximal:** Closer to the origin of the body part or the point of attachment of a limb to the body trunk.
*Example: The elbow is proximal to the wrist.*

**Distal:** Farther from the origin of a body part or the point of attachment of a limb to the body trunk.
*Example: The knee is distal to the thigh.*

**Superficial (External):** Toward or at the body surface.
*Example: The skin is superficial to the skeletal muscles.*

**Deep (Internal):** Away from the body surface; more internal.
*Example: The lungs are deep to the skin.*


## Anatomical Planes

These are hypothetical planes used to transect the body, in order to describe the location of structures or the direction of movements.

**Sagittal Plane:** A vertical plane that divides the body into right and left parts.
* **Midsagittal (Median) Plane:** A sagittal plane that lies exactly in the midline.
* **Parasagittal Plane:** All other sagittal planes, offset from the midline.

**Coronal (Frontal) Plane:** A vertical plane that divides the body into anterior (front) and posterior (back) parts.

**Transverse (Axial) Plane:** A horizontal plane that divides the body into superior (upper) and inferior (lower) parts. It produces a cross-section.

## Powder bed fusion

**Contour:** A defined closed path that traces the outermost region of a 2D slice.

**D10, D50, D90:** The respective percentiles for describing the size distribution of powder particles.

**Design of Experiments (DOE):** A systematic method to study relationships between multiple variables.

**Down-Skin:** Surfaces of a component facing downward relative to the print orientation.

**Hatch:** The path the laser takes to cover the desired area of the 2D slice.

**Island:** A closed region of a 2D slice.

**Neural network:** A process of using a series of algorithms to recognize relationships in data.

**Power:** The laser output at a system level, denoted in watts.

**Response surface methodology (RSM):** A method to explore the relationships between variables that can define the maximum and minimum values of said relationship.

**Shell and Core:** The **core** describes the center region of the component being produced; the **shell** is the outer region.

**Sidewalls:** Any vertical sections at the edge of an island.

**Taguchi method:** A statistical method used to optimize a design.

**Up-Skin:** Surfaces of a component facing upward relative to the print orientation.
