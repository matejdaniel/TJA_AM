    "# Project Assignment: Novel Joint Implant Design Using Additive Manufacturing\n",
    "\n",
    "Your final project is to design a next-generation artificial joint implant. Your challenge is to leverage the unique capabilities of **additive manufacturing (AM)** to develop a creative, patient-specific solution. Think outside the box and propose an innovative concept. A detailed, complex design isn't necessary; a well-explained sketch or conceptual model of your novel idea is sufficient. You'll present your design to the class during our final lecture.\n",

    "## Presentation Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Your presentation should be a concise but comprehensive overview of your concept, covering the following points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Anatomical & Physiological Analysis**\n",
    "    * Describe the **anatomy** of your assigned joint, including its key components (bones, cartilage, ligaments).\n",
    "    * Explain its physiological **function** and range of motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Biomechanical Load Analysis**\n",
    "    * Provide a reasonable **estimation of the loads** (e.g., compression, shear, torsion) that the joint experiences during typical activities like walking, lifting, or chewing. Provide a numerical estimation using simplified reduction model. \n",
    "    * You can also estimate the weight of the relevant body parts to inform your calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Medical Imaging & Patient-Specific Modeling**\n",
    "    * Identify the appropriate **medical imaging** modalities (e.g., CT, MRI) used to visualize the joint.\n",
    "    * Explain how you would use this data for segmentation to create a **2D or 3D model** for a patient-specific implant.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Novel Implant Design Using AM**\n",
    "    * This is the core of your project. Propose a **novel implant design** that could only be practically achieved using additive manufacturing.\n",
    "    * Highlight the specific **advantages of using AM**, such as custom lattice structures for bone ingrowth, complex geometries for better kinematics, or functionally graded materials. Present sketches or basic CAD models of your idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Manufacturing Process & Material Selection**\n",
    "    * Suggest a suitable **AM process** (e.g., Selective Laser Melting - SLM, Electron Beam Melting - EBM).\n",
    "    * Choose an appropriate **biocompatible material** (e.g., Titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V, Co-Cr, PEEK) and justify your choices based on your design's requirements (strength, flexibility, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Verification & Validation Plan**\n",
    "    * Outline a plan of **experiments** you would perform to prove your design is safe and effective before clinical use.\n",
    "    * Consider mechanical testing (e.g., fatigue, wear simulation) and biocompatibility tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **Limitations & Future Scope**\n",
    "    * Critically evaluate your design and identify its potential **limitations** or challenges (e.g., manufacturing constraints, long-term wear, cost).\n",
    "    * Suggest directions for **future work** or potential improvements."
